            <p>At dheerajsingh.in we care deeply about your privacy, and we take pride in being a good steward of any
                data you choose to share with us. If you have any questions about how we use or handle user data, just
                ask and we'll get back to you in a jiffy.</p>
            <h3>General
                being placed on your device. Each browser is different, but generally users can remove cookies by
                following directions provided in the browser’s “help” file. Please note that, if you reject cookies or
                disable cookies, some features of the Service may not function properly.</p>
            <h3>How long we store information</h3>
            <p>dheerajsingh.in will store your data as long as needed to provide you with our services and to operate
                our organization. If you ask dheerajsingh.in to delete specific personal information, we'll honor your
                request unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary functions, like
                calculating taxes or conducting required audits.</p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>We have security measures in place to help protect against the unauthorized access to personally
                identifiable information under our control. We utilize both online and offline security methods,
                including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places where your information is
                stored to help protect personally identifiable information. Our team is trained to comply with our
                security procedures, and our security procedures are regularly reviewed and revised as we deem
                necessary.</p>
            <h3>How you can access and update your information</h3>
            <p>Our goal is for any personal information in our possession to be as accurate, current and complete as
                necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. If you want to review, verify or correct
                your personal information, please contact us using the contact information set out below. We reserve the
                right not to change any personal information and instead append any alternative information the
                individual concerned believes is appropriate. To some extent, we rely on individuals to update their own
                personal information. Unless an individual advises us of these important changes, we may have no way of
                knowing about them.</p>

                to update or amend this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post any revised version of this Privacy
                Policy on our website, and we encourage you to refer back to it on a regular basis. The changes
                contained in any such revised version of this Privacy Policy will be effective from the time such
                revised version is posted unless otherwise specifically stated therein.</p>
